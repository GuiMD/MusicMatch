# MusicMatch Project
The **MusicMatch** project is developed as a hands-on exercise in the **"Java: Applying Object-Oriented Programming"** course from Alura. Unlike the previous project, this one is meant to be implemented independently, allowing for practical application before reviewing the instructorâ€™s solution.

The project reinforces key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as **encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism**, demonstrating how they can be effectively implemented in **Java**.
